            <p>The Porsche 718 Cayman is a proper sports car, offering the perfect balance of performance and luxury. With its mid-engine layout and responsive handling, it delivers an unparalleled driving experience that is both exhilarating and engaging. There is just one problem with the 718 Cayman GT4. While it's street-legal, it is too harsh on the road. It's suspension was too stiff, the seats are uncomfortable during long roads, and it used to be noisy. Some might call that music to their ears, but only for short distances. Nobody wants to listen to that loud induction noise for a long time without wearing a helmet to lower its volume. As a result, the German sports car manufacturer developed the GT4 RS version. It was still a race-ready vehicle, but its manually adjustable suspension, options, and several other tricks transformed it into a better vehicle to drive on public roads.

            <p align="left">The Red Bull Circuit located in Spielberg, Austria is known for its competitive track and stunning views. Designed for high-speed racing, it provides the ideal setting for the Porsche 718 Cayman to showcase its capabilities, offering sensations for both drivers and fans alike. When Formula One outgrew the circuit, a plan was drawn up to extend the layout. Parts of the circuit, including the pits and main grandstand were demolished. However, construction work was stopped, and the circuit remained unusable for several years before it was purchased by Red Bullâ€™s Dietrich Mateschitz and rebuilt. Renamed the Red Bull Ring, the track was reopened on 15 May 2011 and subsequently hosted a round of the 2011 DTM season and a round of the 2011 F2 championship. Formula One returned to the circuit in the 2014 season, and MotoGP returned to the circuit in 2016. The video above is the fastest lap on the circuit held by famous F1 driver Max Verstappen

            <p> The website previewed above is <a href="https://acc-liveries.vercel.app" target="_blank">ACC livery Website</a>  which is a website I've used to preview my liveries/designs and help give me an idea on how my livery design would look on a car in asseto corsa.
                
                First step is to choose a car in the top left, in my case I have chosen the Porsche 718 Cayman the set the colour of the car to full white. To preview my design click on the ACC livery link then take a screenshot of my decal which is under "My plan design using Photoshop"

                save it as a png and go back to the livery website and click "Sync decals" where you will add my decal that is saved as an image this will then preview my livery design. Lastly if you would like to add differnt effects to the car put your cursor on sync decals and customize

                the car with the settings provided this can help create a mettalic/mate finish.
